Codebook for course project
===========================

This describes the variables contained in the table of data generated by
the run_analysis.R script and saved to the file my_tidy_output.txt. This
output shows the average of each variable summarized for each combination
of activity and subject.

activity: One of six activities that the person performed (WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

subject: A number identifying which person out of the 30 volunteers 
performed the activity.

The remaining variables are

[t|f]BodyAcc.[mean|std]...[X|Y|Z]
tGravityAcc.[mean|std]...[X|Y|Z]
[t|f]BodyAccJery.[mean|std]...[X|Y|Z]
[t|f]BodyGyro.[mean|std]...[X|Y|Z]
[t|f]tBodyGyroJerk.[mean|std]...[X|Y|Z]
[t|f]tBodyAccMag.[mean|std]..
tGravityAccMag.[mean|std]..
[t|f]BodyAccJerkMag.[mean|std]..
[t|f]BodyGyroMag.[mean|std]..
[t|f]BodyGyroJerkMag.[mean|std]..

The t or f prefixes indicate whether the data are time-domain (t) or filtered
(f). The mean or std roots indicate whether these values are means or
standard deviations (std). The X, Y, or Z suffixes, where present, indicate
which direction, X, Y, or Z, was measured.

Slightly more complete descriptions of the data are available in the
features_info.txt file here:

The dataset authors don't go into any additional detail regarding what
the part of the variable names like BodyAccJerkMag actually mean, however.
